# Data Manipulation
Data manipulation is a term that describes the process of changing data structures to make them easier to read.

# Object Series
A series is a 1-dimensional object that contains a sequence of values and is associated with a data label, called an index. To create a Series, form it from an array by calling the Series function in pandas.

# loc and iloc
1. *loc* is label-based, which means that you have to specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels.
2. *iloc* is integer position-based, so you have to specify rows and columns by their integer position values (0-based integer position).

# Data Frame
A data frame is a collection of series, with at least one series.
